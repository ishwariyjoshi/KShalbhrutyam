The challenge The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the way we work, socialize and most importantly, how we care for those who are the most vulnerable. Micron is inviting developers, tinkerers, inventors, and researchers of the world to create a cost-effective and safe robotic solution that improves surface sanitation by utilizing UV light to deactivate pathogens. Micron recognizes the current need for low-cost readily available solutions to reduce the transmission of virulent pathogens. We want to assist the global community in this endeavor.
